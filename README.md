+ Adds some sliders to control camera and view bobbing
+ Adds the ability to **Disable** Hand Bobbing when holding an Item from a Configurable List (eg. When holding a Filled Map).
    + Also Adds a Keybind to do that to your currently held item, by default it is bound to nothing so that it doesn't clash with other binds!
